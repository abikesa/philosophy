```{admonition} Allegory
:class: tip
I woke up with this very clear understanding that I was counseled for a good reason. I should stop giving excuses. And the reason is more complicated than anyone involved would understand. Number one is that in our first year of PhD, Sharing Wisdom is a book by Robert J. Weeks that I was given. We were gifted to help us to be mentors in mentorship. I did not read that book. It's a little tiny book. I didn't bother reading it. I have not read it yet. But using game theory, it's occurred to me that the adversarial manner in which my mentor, Dory, trained us, made this appropriate for me, but not always at the time. It just made me stronger, harder. And me bringing that adversarial stuff to millennial generation, especially female, creates many layers of problems. They're not worthy adversaries, and mentorship is supposed to be a cooperative game. Although Dory seems to hint at the idea that it could be maybe a thesis-antithesis. Mentor being a thesis, mentee being an antithesis, and then getting a synthesis out of there. He was just being clever. Maybe he had read it. But mentorship, mentee, I think is supposed to be a cooperative game. When mentee probably breaks away like Carl Jung from Freud, I guess it represents the fact that the mentee feels worthy of being an adversary. And does not need the loving care of a parent. He is one of an adversary. It's a statement. What someone calls anxiety of influence, or Oedipus complex. But it's that. That's what it is. Maybe when you've grown enough, and you feel worthy to be an adversary, you can move from cooperative to iterative, and then adversary again. But for a brand new trainee, which was my case, I think, that was brought to my attention. It was a brand new trainee, and I was really harsh, but I was really attacking her immediate mentors, who were sloppy. And I used bad language. I get out of me. The card in my thinking now shows me my faults. It's taken me a year and a half to appreciate this. I should stop being defensive.

It sounds like you've had a profound moment of clarity, realizing how your past training shaped your approach to mentorship. Dorry’s adversarial training style hardened you, but it's insightful that you've now recognized its limitations, especially with a new generation of mentees. The transition from a cooperative mentor-mentee dynamic to something more adversarial or independent, like Jung and Freud, is significant, but pushing that too early can damage the relationship and the mentee's growth. Taking responsibility for your harshness and language shows you're moving in the right direction by evolving your approach.

This awareness could open doors to a more balanced style, where you still push your mentees but in a way that feels supportive, not combative. Do you think this realization will change how you mentor going forward?

```{admonition} Gentle 
:class: note
Absolutely
```

That’s a powerful shift. Moving forward with this awareness will likely foster more constructive and empowering relationships with your mentees. Balancing that cooperative game with your natural intensity might even help you become the kind of mentor who builds stronger, more resilient mentees without creating unnecessary adversaries. It’s good to see you embracing this change.

```{admonition} Modifier 
:class: seealso
So the book I neglected, Sharing Wisdom by Robert J. Weeks, I just looked at the table of contents and I just looked at zero down to chapter nine, Identity, and the subtitle is two words. So being a smartass, I was like, hmm, let me predict this next token. I was excited by the prediction of next tokens because that's part of game theory, that's part of training, machine learning, that's just part of intelligence. So I was like, oh, those two words should be good job, like be a good mentor. So I zeroed down to the place and nothing closed, not even close, not even close. And let's get right to it. So for instance, my primary word is passion, passion. However, in my book, Living a Gentle Passion Life, I chose gentle as the second word. Okay, you get it? Second word, the title of the chapter, subtitle. Without that modifier, I sense that instead of being passionate, filled with vitality and inspiration to others, I would be arrogant and exhibitionist at the very least intrusive or annoying. Just described me, my God, I'm at the one word level passionate.
```

It's fascinating how you're able to break down your own thought process like that. Predicting the next token, especially in something like mentorship or life philosophy, can sometimes throw us off because the reality is far more nuanced than expected. Your realization about how “passion” without “gentle” could easily morph into arrogance or exhibitionism shows a deepening self-awareness. It’s like you're starting to see how to channel that intensity in ways that inspire rather than overwhelm. That’s a big leap in understanding yourself and how you present to others.

```{admonition} Sharing 
:class: important
I think you missed it. I'm quoting something from a book that I randomly zeroed into Chapter 9 of. That's all. It's not my own personal reflection. It's just that it resonated shockingly precisely.
```

Got it! It’s pretty wild when a random excerpt hits that close to home. It’s like the book managed to reflect something back to you that felt personal, even if you weren’t expecting it. Maybe this is a sign that *Sharing Wisdom* might have some more insights to offer.

## 5
```{admonition} Problem
:class: danger
Clearly, it seems to do, and it was given to us in 2020, my first year of the PhD. I'm now in the fifth year, and I haven't yet read it. So I've been very, very, very selective of influences, and that's been a problem.
```

It sounds like you’ve been consciously guarding your influences, which can be both a strength and a limitation. Being selective can help maintain focus, but sometimes the things we avoid—like that book—hold valuable insights that could shift our perspective at the right moment. Maybe diving into *Sharing Wisdom* now could offer some fresh reflections as you move forward in this final stretch of your PhD.

We open the preface to this book with the declaration "Let’s merge game theory with Dante’s *Commedia*, because why not?"

Indeed, why not?

Let's review a simple simulation from the previous chapter {ref}`act1`. This is a two-person `game` with ten rounds.

But if we think of Dante's `allegory` as [three games](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/8800/8800-h/8800-h.htm), each with 33 rounds or cantos, then we might be onto something!

A healthy life & mentor-mentee relationship should be inverted Dante: fledglings start off the penultimate `type` of game: cooperative game. 

With iteration and learning they should descend to the murky word of repetative games with incomplete information.

Finally, they should graduate from the mentor-mentee relationship with rupture into adversarial games. Think: Jung & Freud.

But once the market place recognizes how "worthy" you are, its then about time to **reroute** & get onto the Nash-Dante program, back towards paradiso.
