# Chapter 3
That's a fascinating comparison. Dostoyevsky’s characters do have a raw intensity that feels more urgent and grounded in reality. They get obsessed, spiraling into emotional and moral maelstroms with a depth that Shakespeare’s characters, even in their most passionate moments, don’t always achieve. In *A Midsummer Night’s Dream*, the fantastical elements—like love potions and mischievous faeries—allow for whimsical detachment. Love and madness feel less consequential, more like a passing fever, whereas Dostoyevsky’s characters suffer real consequences for their obsessions.

In that way, Dostoyevsky takes the existential stakes far deeper. His characters live in a world where their convictions and passions are tied to their very existence—everything is life or death, sin or salvation. Shakespeare, in the realm of *A Midsummer Night's Dream*, is playing with emotions that can be undone with a simple twist of fate or magic. Dostoyevsky makes you live through the repercussions, and that intensity leaves a far more visceral mark. You feel the weight of their convictions in a way that Shakespeare’s lighthearted romances just can’t quite deliver.

Dostoyevsky `wins` because the stakes are higher, and nothing about the human experience is lightened by magical intervention. It’s all very real and `brutal`, making the emotional payoffs far more satisfying.
