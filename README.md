1. Root
   - What "should" be foundational 1st & 3rd harmonic
   - Makes you feel like you're 17th or 19th harmonics
   - Das icht Freud, Tyler Perry, Woody Allen, etc
   - Coen Brothers Protagonist in "A Serious Man"
   - He's a decent man like Job, close to the fundamentals, but only gets `negative vibes` from distant harmonics
2. Pentatonic
3. Diatonic
4. Chromatic
5. Temperament
6. Expression
   - Withdraw: `Self`
      - Freud and navel-gazing/brooding following skills-challenge mismatch
         - Rick Dalton of Tarantino's "Once Upon a Time in Hollywood"
         - Sexy-evil Hamlet, or is it Edmund from King Lear?
         - Quenten like Mirabella withdrew into Hollywood's 1960s film as a child to excape his unstructured life
         - Tyler Perry says pretty much though his was not to Hollywood but the black community (his aunt, church, etc)
         - Woody withdrew into a more intellectual journey that found its voice in Freudian vocabulary
         - Coen brothers had a secure mid-western up-bringing but the clash between orthodox judaism and mid-western america provides a rich tension
   - Engage: `Neighbor`
      - Marx and amplitude of united whiners or SAG
   - Impose: `God's Will`
      - Nietzsche & implications of God's death
      - Tarantino will always have characters who bully, are anarchist (Mr. Blonde), etc.
         - He will not offer sufficient backstory in case you wish to `cherche la femme` to figure-out the "will-to-hide"
